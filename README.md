> Shareable ESLint config to make "Prime Grade" quality code

Getting Started
---------------
> It is assumed that you have already configured your project to use ESLint.  If this is not
the case, please see the [ESLint documentation](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring).

#1 Add **omaha-prime-grade** to the `extends` object of your ESLint configuration file

module.exports = {
    extends: 'omaha-prime-grade'
};
```
- JSON

{
    "extends": "omaha-prime-grade"

#2 **Smile**. You are done. Your code will thank you later.

Why "Prime Grade"?
------------------
- Omaha is known for its [high quality steak](http://www.omahasteaks.com/buy/Steaks).
- Omaha should be known for just **high quality** (or at least high quality steak **and** code).
- After ruminating on the concept of "high quality beef", I found that beef has some [serious quality metrics](https://meat.tamu.edu/beefgrading/).
- As a resident engineer of Omaha that loves high quality and the metrics that maintain it...Applying the concept of "Prime Grade" to code seemed like a fairly obvious thing to do :smile:
